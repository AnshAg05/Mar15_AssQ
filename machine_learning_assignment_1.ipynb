    "Unsupervised learning techniques are commonly used in anomaly detection tasks due to their ability to identify patterns and structures within data without the need for labeled examples of anomalies. Here's how unsupervised learning can be used in anomaly detection:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Clustering-based Anomaly Detection**:\n",
    "   - Clustering algorithms like k-means or DBSCAN can be used to group similar data points together. Anomalies are often defined as data points that do not belong to any cluster or belong to a cluster with significantly fewer points.\n",
    "   - Data points that are distant from the centroids of their respective clusters or fall in sparsely populated clusters can be flagged as anomalies.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Density-based Anomaly Detection**:\n",
    "   - Density estimation techniques such as Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) or Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) can be used to estimate the underlying distribution of the data.\n",
    "   - Anomalies can be identified as data points that have low probability density according to the estimated distribution. Data points in low-density regions or distant from high-density clusters are often considered anomalies.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Autoencoder-based Anomaly Detection**:\n",
    "   - Autoencoders are neural network architectures trained to reconstruct input data from a compressed representation (latent space).\n",
    "   - During training, the autoencoder learns to reconstruct normal, non-anomalous data accurately. However, anomalies may not be well-reconstructed by the autoencoder since they deviate significantly from the patterns observed in the training data.\n",
    "   - Thus, high reconstruction errors for input data points may indicate the presence of anomalies.\n",

    "4. **Isolation Forest**:\n",
    "   - Isolation Forest is an algorithm specifically designed for anomaly detection. It isolates anomalies by recursively partitioning the data space using randomly chosen features.\n",
    "   - Anomalies are isolated more quickly than normal data points due to their rarity, resulting in shorter average path lengths in the tree structures built by the algorithm.\n",

    "   - One-Class Support Vector Machines (SVMs) learn a decision boundary around normal data points to distinguish them from anomalies.\n",
